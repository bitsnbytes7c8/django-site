# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is a basic django-site, which lets users sign-in and sign-up, and set up a minimal profile which other users can search for and find.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy the entire code structure to a django-project named mysiteproject and do python manage.py runserver to get the server up and running.
* Requires django 1.8 or above.
* Uses sqlite as the database
* The code is not production ready - use any django setup guide to get it deployed to a prod server.
